The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
There are four types of loops in JavaScript.
for loop
while loop
do-while loop
for-in loop
I want to explain some of types of loops for example :
While loop :The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known.
A while loop statement repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
while(condition) {
statement(s);
}
statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.
When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
for - loops through a block of code a number of times
A "For" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times. For example, if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number. When the number of times is not known before hand, we use a "While" loop.
afor loops uses a Counter as a condition this instrcut the code to run a specified number of times.
The condition i≈ü made up of there statement :
intialization creat a variable and set it to zero this variable is commonly called i and it acts as the Counter
var i =0;
Condition the loop should continue to run until the Counter reach es aspcifed number
Var i <10;
Update every time the loop has run a statement in the curly braces it add one to the counter
i++
Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result: some examples of Comparsion operator : ==, ===,! =,! ==, <, >.. etc
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.some example of logical operator: & &(and), ||(or),! (not).
