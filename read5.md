CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
is the language we use to style an HTML document.
and it describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
CSS is used to control the style and layout of multiple web pages all at once.
and it enables you to change the appearance and layout of all the pages in a Web site.
Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear.
CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration
Selectors indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas
Declarations indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
