Version Control
We can do by version control many things like we can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals and compare changes.
By using the VCS (version control system) We can easily correct mistakes.
Now CVCS(Centralized Version system) ! I understand when l read that CVCS It involves a single server that stores all the changes and versions of the files that can be accessed by different clients, one of the most important things that has changed has given the officials much more control over the evaluation of review privileges..
DVCS( Disitrbuted version System)I deal with a big problem and easy to work for example in case of damage to the hard disk of the central data base with no backup we will lose a lot so DVCS is dealing with this problem by allowing customers to create identical repositories can easily put data backups on the server to replace any missing information. One of the example about DVCS the Git
In 2005, when Git was established, it became one of the world's most widely used version control systems, for Git has several benefits and advantages. Git reduce risk data loss and allows our to track file revision to show a change history anthor thing Git It detects data corruption or loss in transit.
Files in Git can exist in three instances
1_ commitment
2_ amendment
3_ coding
Git Helps us to take projects from github and adjust them and make them push also once on the github
