Operators
Thing that the expressions rely on it called operators
it allow to programmers to creat a single value from one or more values
Operator performs some operation on single or multiple open and produce the result
We have many exemples of the operator like(

l want to explain some of these operator
Addition operator it purpose to add one value to anthor. For examples
Var x=10;
Var y=3;
Var z=x+y;
The result iş 13
The assignment operator (=) assigns value to a variable
addition operator (+) add one or more value.
Multiplication operator (*) it purpose múltiples two values using aseterisk
FOR example :
Var x=10;
Var y=3;
Var z =x*y; the result iş 30
Subtraction operator (_) it purpose subtract one value from anthor for example :
Var x= 10;
Var y =3;
Var z= x_y; the result iş 7
#Decrement operator (--) it purpose subtract one from the current number
Foe example :
Var i=7;
var z =i--; result is 6
#Division operator (/) divide to value
var x = 10;
var y =2;
Var z =x/y ; result iş 5
We must focus the very important thing the Matimatical prioritet
For example "always the multiplication and division are performed before addition or subtraction"
Like
Var x = 3*2+6; result is 12
Avery important point if we have parentheses then it has priority
For ex:
var x= 3*(2+6);result 24
##string operator (process of joining to gather two or more strings to creat one new string concatenation.
FOR example
var name = 'Rawan' ;
var number =8;
Var add =name +number result is Rawan8


A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
Function Definition
Before we use a function, we need to define it. The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces..
