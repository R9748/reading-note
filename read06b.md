The importance of technology in our life technology helps us everywhere and at any time and makes it easier for us to do a lot of things for example we can communicate with others even if we are in another country the world is in our hands thanks to technology
Computer work on ones zeros inside computer var wires and circuits
If you're going to be able to store more wires, we get more bits, more zeros, more ones, more information.
Decimal we have te'n numbers ( from 0 to 9)
Binary Number system
We have two numbers, zero and one, and the higher the numbers, the more information that is stored.
Any number can be representes with 0,1 or work on or off.
For example, using 8 wires, we can store numbers between zero and 255 using only 32 wires, we can store everything from zero to more than 4 billion using the binary number
System We can show whatever number we want.
Type of information like text images, Sound all thes can be represented with numbers.
Ä°nput and output are type of information can presented by on or off ore one or zero

In order to process the information that comes in the form of inputs and make it as output the computer needs to modify and integrate the signals entering the computer uses the computer and millions of small electronic components that combine to form circles example of a simple circle by taking a signal connected or separated and reflected if it gives a signal 1, the circle will give you 0 if you give the circle 0 will give you 1 signal that enters is not itself coming out called the circle of exile
Complicat ed circuits take Multiple signals and combine them to give different results the circuit Will only

An input device sends information to a computer system for processing, and an output device reproduces or displays the results of that processing. Input devices only allow for input of data to a computer and output devices only receive the output of data from another device.
For example, a keyboard sends electrical signals, which are received as input. Those signals are then interpreted by the computer and displayed, or output, on the monitor as text or images., the computer sends, or outputs, data to a printer. Then, that data is printed onto a piece of paper, which is also considered output.
output device can receive data from another device and generate output with that data, but it cannot send data to another device. Examples of output :moninter,projector,speakers...
Memory is a Physical device capable of storing information temporarily like Ram
Or permanetly like Rom
CPU for "Central Processing Unit." The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions
Hardware refers to the physical and visible components of the system such as a monitor, CPU, keyboard and mouse. Software, on the other hand, refers to a set of instructions which enable the hardware to perform a specific set of tasks.
Examples of hardware in a computer are the Processor, Memory Devices, Monitor, Printer, Keyboard, Mouse, and the Central Processing Unit. Computer Software: Software is a collection of instructions, procedures, documentation that performs different tasks on a computer
